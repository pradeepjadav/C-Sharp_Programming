# 📘 C# Programming Roadmap (Following 80/20 Principle)

Learn **C# from basics to advanced** with an **80/20 approach**:  
- **20% theory** → understand key concepts.  
- **80% practice** → build small projects and solve problems.  

This roadmap combines **fundamental topics + advanced professional skills** so you can grow from **beginner** to **expert developer**.

---

## 🌱 Beginner (Foundation Layer)
> Goal: Get comfortable writing, running, and understanding C# basics.

| Topic | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| Setup & Hello World | First step to start coding |
| Programming Fundamentals (Input/Output, Variables, Data Types) | Foundation of every program |
| Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical) | Core for calculations & decision-making |
| Control Flow (if-else, switch, loops) | 80% of logic comes from decisions & repetitions |
| Methods / Functions (parameters, return values, overloads) | Code reusability & clean structure |
| Arrays & Strings | Essential for storing and manipulating data |
| Exception Handling (try-catch-finally, custom exceptions) | Reliable error handling |

🔑 **Practice Ideas:**  
- Build a calculator  
- Check prime/palindrome numbers  
- String manipulation (reverse, count vowels)  
- Mini “Guess the Number” game

## 🏗️ Intermediate (Core C#)
> Goal: Move from simple programs to **real-world coding patterns**.

| Topic | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| Object-Oriented Programming ([OOP (Core Building Layer)]: Classes & Objects, Constructors, Inheritance & base/derived classes, Polymorphism [method overriding, virtual/override], Encapsulation [get/set, access modifiers], Abstraction [abstract class, interface]) | 80% of real-world projects are OOP-based |
| Constructors, Fields,, Properties, Static Members | Core structure of enterprise apps |
| Structs vs Classes, Enums | Lightweight data structures |
| Collections (`List`, `Dictionary`, `Queue`, `Stack`, `HashSet`) | Replace arrays with flexible data handling |
| Generics (`List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>`) | Strongly typed reusable collections |
| LINQ (Basics: `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy`) | 80% of data querying solved in fewer lines |
| File I/O (Read/Write text, JSON, XML) | Required in most enterprise applications |
| Delegates & Events | Foundation for event-driven programming |
| Lambda Expressions & Anonymous Methods | Core for LINQ & concise coding |
| Nullable Types & Null-Coalescing | Safer and cleaner code |

🔑 **Practice Ideas:**  
- Bank Account System (OOP)  
- Library Management System  
- Employee Tracker with LINQ  
- File-based Todo List App

## 🚀 Advanced (Professional Development Layer)
> Goal: Write **clean, scalable, and maintainable code**.

| Topic | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| Interfaces & Abstract Classes | Key for dependency injection & loose coupling |
| Dependency Injection (DI) | Core in ASP.NET Core & testable code |
| Asynchronous Programming (`async`, `await`, Tasks, Threads) | Modern responsive apps |
| Attributes & Reflection | Used in frameworks & libraries |
| Entity Framework Core (ORM basics) | 80% of DB work without raw SQL |
| Design Patterns (Singleton, Repository, Factory, Observer) | Standard reusable solutions |
| Unit Testing & Mocking (xUnit, NUnit, Moq) | Saves debugging time |
| Tuples & Pattern Matching | Concise and powerful coding |
| Memory Management | Garbage Collector basics |
| Records (C# 9+) | Immutable, value-based objects |
| C# 10/11/12 new features (depending on .NET version) |

🔑 **Practice Ideas:**  
- Weather API Caller (async/await)  
- CRUD App with EF Core  
- Implement Repository Pattern  
- Write Unit Tests for Employee App  

---

## 🏆 Expert (Real-World Mastery)
> Goal: Build **enterprise-grade, scalable, cloud-ready applications**.

| Topic | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| Microservices with C# | Modern scalable architecture |
| Clean Architecture & SOLID Principles | Maintainability & scalability |
| Multithreading & Parallel Programming | High-performance systems |
| Span, Memory, Performance Optimization | Needed for large-scale apps |
| Advanced LINQ & Expression Trees | Build powerful dynamic queries |
| Source Generators & Roslyn | Compiler-level customization |
| Cloud Integration (Azure SDK for C#) | Needed for cloud-native apps |
| C# 9–12 Features (Records, Pattern Matching, Minimal APIs) | Stay up-to-date |

🔑 **Practice Ideas:**  
- Microservice-based Inventory System  
- Async File Downloader with Parallelism  
- Azure-integrated Task Manager  
- Clean Architecture Web API

## Real-World Development Layer and interviews
> Goal: Apply C# in projects and interviews.

| Topic | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| .NET Fundamentals (CLR, BCL, CTS) |
| C# with Databases (ADO.NET, EF Core basics) |
| Unit Testing (xUnit / NUnit / MSTest) |
| Design Patterns (Singleton, Repository, Factory, Dependency Injection) |
| Best Practices (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI) |
| API Development Basics (REST using .NET Core) |

🔑 **Practice Ideas:**  
- Build a capstone project (Task Manager, Notes App, Inventory System).

---

## 📌 How to Learn (80/20 Rule)
- **20% Theory** → Read docs, tutorials, and short notes.  
- **80% Practice** → Build projects, solve coding challenges, refactor code.  
- Focus on **small, practical apps** at each level.  
- Apply concepts immediately in **mini-projects**.
