# ðŸ“˜ C# Programming

It covers **C# concepts from basic to advanced** that are essential for real-world development.

---

| Level | Topic / Concept | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Beginner (Basics)** | Programming Fundamentals (Input/Output, Variables, Data Types) | Foundation of every program |
|  | Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical) | Core for calculations & decision-making |
|  | Control Flow (if, else, switch, loops) | 80% of logic comes from decisions & repetitions |
|  | Methods / Functions (parameters, return values) | Code reusability & clean structure |
|  | Arrays & Strings | Essential data storage & text manipulation |
|  | Exception Handling (try-catch-finally) | Reliable error handling in apps |
| **Intermediate (Core C#)** | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP: Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction) | 80% of real-world projects are OOP-based |
|  | Collections (List, Dictionary, Queue, Stack) | Replace arrays with flexible data handling |
|  | Generics (`List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>`) | Strongly typed reusable collections |
|  | LINQ (Basics: `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy`) | 80% of data querying solved in fewer lines |
|  | File I/O (Read/Write text, JSON, XML) | Required in most enterprise applications |
|  | Asynchronous Programming (`async`, `await`, Tasks) | Handles modern apps with performance & responsiveness |
| **Advanced (Professional)** | Delegates & Events | Foundation for event-driven programming |
|  | Lambda Expressions & Anonymous Methods | Core for LINQ, concise coding |
|  | Interfaces & Abstract Classes | Key for dependency injection & loose coupling |
|  | Dependency Injection (DI) | Core in ASP.NET Core & testable code |
|  | Attributes & Reflection | Used in frameworks, metadata, libraries |
|  | Entity Framework Core (ORM basics) | 80% of database work without raw SQL |
|  | Design Patterns (Singleton, Repository, Factory, Observer) | Common reusable solutions in enterprise apps |
|  | Unit Testing & Mocking (xUnit, NUnit, Moq) | 80% of debugging saved via tests |
| **Expert (Real-World Mastery)** | Microservices with C# | Modern scalable architecture |
|  | Clean Architecture & SOLID Principles | Industry-standard maintainability |
|  | Multithreading & Parallel Programming | Needed for high-performance systems |
|  | Span, Memory, Performance Optimization | Critical for large-scale apps |
|  | Advanced LINQ & Expression Trees | Build powerful dynamic queries |
|  | Source Generators & Roslyn | For advanced compiler-level customization |
|  | Cloud Integration (Azure SDK for C#) | Needed for cloud-native apps |
|  | C# 9â€“12 Features (Records, Pattern Matching, Minimal APIs) | Stay up-to-date & efficient |
